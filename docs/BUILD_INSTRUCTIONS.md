# Building on Physical Devices

## iOS (Xcode)

1. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/itorophilip/Projects/PricePulse/mobile
   open ios/*.xcworkspace
   ```
   (Use `.xcworkspace`, not `.xcodeproj`)

2. **In Xcode:**
   - Select your physical iOS device from the device dropdown (top toolbar)
   - Click the "Play" button or press `Cmd + R` to build and run
   - First time: You may need to sign the app with your Apple Developer account
     - Go to: Project Settings → Signing & Capabilities
     - Select your Team
     - Xcode will automatically manage provisioning

3. **If you get signing errors:**
   - Add your Apple ID in Xcode: Preferences → Accounts
   - Select your team in the project settings
   - Xcode will create a development certificate automatically

## Android (Android Studio)

1. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/itorophilip/Projects/PricePulse/mobile
   open -a "Android Studio" android
   ```

2. **In Android Studio:**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete
   - Connect your Android device via USB
   - Enable USB Debugging on your device:
     - Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging
   - Select your device from the device dropdown
   - Click the "Run" button or press `Shift + F10`

3. **If device not detected:**
   - Make sure USB Debugging is enabled
   - Run: `adb devices` to verify connection
   - Accept the USB debugging prompt on your device

## Notes

- The native folders (`ios/` and `android/`) are generated by `expo prebuild`
- If you make changes to `app.json`, run `npx expo prebuild` again to sync changes
- Native code changes should be made in the `ios/` and `android/` folders
- React Native/Expo code changes are in the `app/` folder
